# gateviz

GateViz is a logic circuit visualization tool. It is designed to help students better understand combinational logic. This project is currently in redevelopment and refactor using React, Redux, an API layer with a mocked database return. That migration is also in the middle of a refactor implimenting openAPI and Typescript. Migration to typescript should be functional shortly. See the wiki for upcoming tasks.
